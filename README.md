## Description
Recreation of the Uthernet II Apple II Network Expansion Card using KiCAD 6.x.<br />

This version is NOT compatible with the light pipe system of the original.<br />
The board size is limited to 100mm x 100mm to make it cheaper to produce.<br />
This layout may be able to be improved.
