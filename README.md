## Description
Recreation of the Uthernet II Apple II Network Expansion Card using KiCAD 6.0.x.<br />
This version is a recreation of the Uthernet II board with the 80-pin WizNet W5100 chip.  
This version is NOT compatible with the [light pipe system](https://www.tindie.com/products/option8/uthernet-ii-light-pipe/) of the original.<br />
The cutout on the right is to accommodate [Adafruit's Panel Mount Ethernet Extension Cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/909) if the card is put into Slot #2 on an Apple IIgs. <br />
Very little about the layout may need to be changed. <br />
Some parts may be difficult to source for PCB assembly unless you preorder them in advance.
